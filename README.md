# Fibonacci
The Fibonacci numbers are one our favorite sets. It's a sequence of numbers that been discovered multiple times and introduced to Europeans by an Italian mathematician who gave the sequence its name in 1202. Somehow, Fibonacci numbers are found all over mathematics, computer science, the natural world--most famously in the arrangement of a pine cone's scales.
