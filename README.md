# Fibonacci
The Fibonacci numbers are one our favorite sets. It's a sequence of numbers that been discovered multiple times, probably first in Ancient India, and introduced to Europeans by an Italian mathematician who gave the sequence its name in 1202. Fibonacci numbers are found all over mathematics, computer science, the natural world--most beautifully in the arrangement of a pine cone's scales.

Fibonacci numbers are easy but expensive to calculate (if we skip over the first three). Here are the first 10:

| F0 | F1 | F2 | F3 | F4 | F5 | F6 | F7 | F8 | F9 |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
|  0 |  1 |  1 |  2 |  3 |  5 |  8 | 13 | 21 | 34 |

Do you see the pattern, after three, the next Fibonacci number is the sum of the previous two.
